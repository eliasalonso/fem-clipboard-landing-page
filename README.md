## My process

HTML Structure: I started by setting up the basic HTML structure with appropriate elements like <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>. I also added a meta tag for viewport settings to ensure the site displays correctly on various devices.

Styling with CSS: I used CSS to style the website. I defined custom variables for colors, fonts, and font sizes at the :root level to maintain consistency and reusability throughout the page.

Header Section: I created a header section with a background image and a centered logo. The header also includes a title, description, and buttons to download the app for iOS and Mac.

First Article Section: In this section, I designed a grid layout with an image on one side (showing a Macbook with a sea background) and information on the other side. The information includes headings and descriptions about the app's features like quick search, iCloud sync, and complete history.

Second Article Section: This section presents information about accessing Clipboard on various devices. It includes images of an iPad and iPhone with sea backgrounds, along with headings and descriptions about the app's capabilities, such as creating blacklists, removing formatting from copied text, and a sneak preview of all snippets.

Logos Section: I created a section to showcase logos of companies that use Clipboard. The logos are displayed in a grid layout.

Third Article Section: This section emphasizes the availability of Clipboard on iOS and Mac OS. It includes a description and buttons to download the app for iOS and Mac.

Footer Section: Finally, I designed the footer section with links to FAQs, Contact Us, Privacy Policy, and Press Kit. It also includes social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) as links.

Media Queries: To ensure the website is responsive and looks good on larger screens, I added media queries for screens with a minimum width of 90rem. The media queries adjust font sizes, grid layouts, and padding to provide an optimal user experience on larger devices.

By following these steps, I successfully completed the coding challenge and created a visually appealing and responsive landing page for Clipboard.

### What I learned

HTML Structure: I reinforced my understanding of the basic HTML structure, including the use of tags like <head>, <body>, and semantic elements to create well-organized and meaningful web pages.

CSS Styling: I further honed my CSS skills, particularly in applying styles to various elements using classes, IDs, and custom CSS properties. I also explored the use of CSS variables to maintain consistency and ease of updating styles across the entire website.

Responsive Design: I delved into the world of responsive design, employing media queries to adapt the layout and styling of the website based on different screen sizes. This skill is crucial for ensuring a seamless user experience on various devices.

Grid Layouts: I practiced creating grid layouts to structure content in a visually appealing and efficient manner. Grid layouts help to organize elements on the page, especially when designing responsive websites.

Flexbox: I utilized Flexbox to create flexible and responsive components, such as aligning buttons in the header and arranging icons in the article section. Flexbox is a valuable tool for handling complex layout challenges.

Typography: I learned the importance of choosing appropriate fonts and font sizes to enhance readability and maintain a consistent visual identity across the site.

Image Handling: I gained experience in optimizing images for web use, ensuring they load quickly and look sharp on all devices.

Problem-Solving: Throughout the challenge, I encountered and resolved various design and layout issues. This allowed me to strengthen my problem-solving skills and think critically about implementing the desired design.

Version Control: I practiced using version control tools like Git to track changes, which is essential for collaboration and keeping a history of project iterations.

Web Accessibility: While not explicitly mentioned, I became more aware of the importance of web accessibility and the need to ensure that the website is usable by people with disabilities.
